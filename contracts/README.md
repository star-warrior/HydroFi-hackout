### Step-by-Step Deployment

#### 1. Setup Environment

Make sure your `.env` file is configured:

```bash
PRIVATE_KEY=your_test_private_key_here
MUMBAI_RPC_URL=https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_PROJECT_ID
BSC_TESTNET_RPC_URL=https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.binance.org:8545
```

#### 2. Get Free Testnet Funds

Visit the faucet for your chosen network and request free tokens using your wallet address.

#### 3. Deploy Your Contract

```bash
# Mumbai (Recommended - fastest and cheapest)
npm run deploy-mumbai

# Or use the interactive helper
npm run deploy-free -- --network mumbai
```

#### 4. Verify Deployment

After deployment, you'll see:

- ‚úÖ Contract address
- üîó Explorer link to view your contract
- üíæ Contract data saved to `backend/contract-data.json`

### Commands Reference

```bash
# Check wallet balance
npm run balance -- --network mumbai

# Deploy to specific networks
npm run deploy-mumbai      # Deploy to Mumbai
npm run deploy-sepolia     # Deploy to Sepolia
npm run deploy-bsc         # Deploy to BSC Testnet

# General deployment with network flag
npm run deploy-free -- --network mumbai
```

### Troubleshooting

**‚ùå "Insufficient funds" error:**

- Visit the faucet for your network
- Request free tokens
- Wait for confirmation
- Try deployment again

**‚ùå "Network not found" error:**

- Check your `.env` file
- Verify RPC URLs are correct
- Make sure network is defined in `hardhat.config.js`

**‚ùå "Transaction failed" error:**

- Try increasing gas limit
- Check network status

### After Deployment

1. **Update Backend:** Contract data is automatically saved to `backend/contract-data.json`
2. **Update Frontend:** Use the contract address in your React app
3. **Test dApp:** Connect your frontend to the deployed contract
4. **Optional:** Verify your contract on the explorer
